    "Additionally, we will track the most popular pizza in a state. This will be done by counting all pizzas received for each state. A potential problem will be that the most popular pizzas in a state might differ by a single topping.

We will then visualize this data by showing a picture of the most popular pizza over its corresponding state on a map of the United States.\n",
